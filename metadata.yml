description: >-
  These are my lecture notes on some advanced topics in experimental physics. We
  discuss the concept of Fourier transform, which is used in optics and X-ray
  scattering, and the concept of hybridization with examples from classical
  physics, quantum physics and quantum optics. In the concluding chapter, we
  discuss lattices of plasmonic particles that unify everything.
