# Selected topics in advanced experimental physics

These are my lecture notes on some advanced topics in experimental physics

The lecture notes are typeset using the LaTeX class ['tufte-book'](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/) by Bil Kleb, Bill Wood, and Kevin Godby, which approximates the work of [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/). I applied many of the modifications introduced by Dirk Eddelbuettel in the ['tint'](https://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/tint.html}) R package. For the time being, the source is LaTeX, not markdown.

## Structure of the repository

The chapters are individual tex-files in the directory tree and included in the main tex file. Figures are mostly made by tikz. Tikz-external is used to save compilation time. It generates pdfs in the figures tree. Some chapters contain handout material for exercises, which is in the handout subdirectory of the chapter.
